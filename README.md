# Analyzing Brand Equity for Galeries Lafayette Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)

To conduct this brand equity analysis, the marketing manager of Galeries Lafayette provided us with
a dataset containing responses from 553 customers to a questionnaire. This dataset includes various
questions aimed at evaluating customers’ perceptions of the company’s image and services.

Understanding brand equity is crucial for any business, as it directly impacts customer loyalty, retention,
and long-term profitability. In this case, the objective is to explore how customers perceive Galeries
Lafayette and to identify the factors that influence their loyalty and commitment to the brand.

We will first conduct an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to uncover the dimensions by which customers
view the company. Following that, we will build a structural equation model (SEM) to assess how these
factors impact customer loyalty and commitment.

This analysis will provide Galeries Lafayette with valuable insights, offering a causal model that high-
lights the most important factors contributing to brand equity and their interrelationships.
These segments offer valuable insights for the marketing team, enabling them to refine marketing
strategies, tailor product offerings, and enhance overall customer engagement.
